# FRAMEWORK_CSS
Personal Framework css

Using Gulp for compilation sass, minify, and purgecss

## WHY THIS FRAMEWORK
I really like tailwind, but i don't like doing full html.
I like the mix between "pre generate class" who help me build layout...
And using BEM to creat class for my component and doing all the css myself.
Also my mixin are more usefull than css class.
